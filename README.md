# BERT

This code deals with BERT embeddings on the CrisisNLP dataset.
BERT embeddings by this time you would have known Google's recent model used for embedding words.
It has been applied to the above mentioned dataset and clusters have been formed using Kmode algorithm.
The centroids are then fed as features to the classifiers namely, SVM, RF and LR. 
Further preprocessing has to be done in the way of increasing the accuracy level.
The main motive is finally to achieve sentiment analysis.


Here California Earthquake tweets have been used as dataset.
And another dataset indicates the label of tweets which has been used in the classification along wtth the former dataset


And BTW you may see some of the code execution commands in between since it has been worked in google colab it seems as such.
I solemnly apologize for the convenience.
